# AngularUdemyNotes

This is my notebook for an Angular complete tutorial on Udemy

https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/

Angular is aJavaScript Framework alowing to create reactive Single-Page-Applications (SPAs).
* an application that loads only one html file and renders views in the browser
* instead of making calls to the server each time the page needs to be changed
* it's much faster - gives better user experience (no waiting to load time)

## Angular versioning:
AngularJS - first angular framework

2016 it was rewritten and
Angular2 - refered to as Angular as all later versions are improvments on that framework (Angular3 was skipped)

## Angualr CLI

runs on node.js
once you have node.js installed run:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli@latest

ng new my-new-project

cd my-new-project

ng serve
```

the local page is going to be served at

```
localhost:4200
```




This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.20.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
